# whatcha-watchin
This project was built out to satisfy the requirements for the FlatIron Sinatra Portfolio Project. That said, this was not deployed as a website so a bit of legwork is necessary to get it running.

## Installation

To get this site up and running clone this repo down to your local environment by running the command `git clone git@github.com:educhin/whatcha-watchin.git` in your console.

Once the repo has been cloned to your local device cd into the project folder and run the command `bundle install` followed by 'shotgun' and copy and paste the resulting address in your web browser to get the site running.
